osgi-samples/hibernate demonstrates how to use Hibernate in OSGi.  

The solution is roughly based on the article by [http://www.osgi.org/blog/labels/osgi%20hibernate%20felix%20equinox%20eclipse%20knopflerfish%20sql.html  Peter Kriens].
Peter's design uses a declaration in the manifest file to declaratively add classes to the Hibernate session using an _extender model_.  In this implementation we currently do not use the extender model but instead explicitly add new classes to the Hibernate session through a bundle activator.

To get the source code for the hibernate sample, use SVN:

svn checkout http://voluble.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/osgi-samples/hibernate/ osgi-hibernate-sample

You should then be able to run "mvn install" in the new osgi-hibernate-sample folder and see all projects build successfully.  

  At the moment you need to first manually start a HSQLDB database before the tests will run.  After downloading a hsqldb.jar, you can start the database from the command line using:

 java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database.0 file:osgi-hibernate-sample.db -dbname.0 osgi-hibernate-sample

  (Hopefully this is temporary and we'll soon change the code to start the database automatically).
